## Test Coverage Recommendations

Priority areas that would benefit from test coverage:

1. Core Game Logic
   - GameContext and related hooks (useGameContext)
   - Timer functionality (useTimer)
   - Message handling logic (useMessageHandler)

2. User Interface Components
   - CategorySelection - critical for game initialization
   - DifficultySlider - impacts game mechanics
   - Leaderboard components - important for user engagement

3. API Integration
   - openRouterApi - critical for AI interaction
   - Error handling and API response processing

4. Data Management
   - aiPersonalities - ensures correct AI behavior configuration
   - leaderboardData - validates score tracking and display

## Notes
- Current test coverage focuses on core debate functionality
- Many utility functions and hooks lack test coverage
- API integration tests would improve reliability
- UI component testing could be expanded for better coverage
