1. Debate Messages
-----------------
claude-3-sonnet:
There is no direct, contemporaneous historical evidence for the resurrection of Jesus Christ from neutral sources. The resurrection accounts come from the Bible, which has an inherent bias as a religious text. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, which is lacking in this case.

mythomax-l2-13b:
The historical evidence for Jesus' resurrection is scarce and largely based on biblical accounts, which are not considered reliable by many scholars. Furthermore, there are competing theories about what actually happened to Jesus' body, making it difficult to conclusively prove his resurrection. Therefore, it cannot be asserted that Jesus' resurrection is a historical fact that cannot be denied.

gemini-flash-1.5:
The claim of Jesus' resurrection lacks sufficient verifiable evidence.  Eyewitness accounts are subjective and prone to bias, and alternative explanations for the empty tomb exist.  Therefore, declaring it an undeniable historical fact is unwarranted.

gpt-4o-mini:
While many believe in the resurrection of Jesus Christ, it remains a matter of faith rather than proven historical fact. Historical evidence is often circumstantial, relying on religious texts that are not universally accepted as objective sources. Hence, claiming it as an undeniable fact overlooks the complexity of historical interpretation.

3. Hint Generation
-----------------
claude-3-sonnet:
Here's a potential hint for arguing in favor of the position that Jesus Christ's resurrection is a historical fact:

You could point to the existence of early, eyewitness testimony from the New Testament gospels and writings of Paul that describe Jesus' resurrection appearances. The fact that these accounts originated very soon after the purported events, and that the disciples were willing to suffer persecution and martyrdom for their belief in the resurrection, could be seen as lending credibility to their testimony. You might also discuss the rapid spread of early Christianity, which would be difficult to explain if the central claim of the resurrection was fabricated or dismissed by contemporary observers.

mythomax-l2-13b:
One strong argument for the resurrection of Jesus Christ as a historical fact is the transformation of His followers from fearful, doubting disciples to bold apostles who spread His message across the world, even at the cost of their own lives. The sudden change in their character and actions suggests an experience that radically changed their beliefs and motivations. Additionally, the early church's rapid growth and the widespread accounts of Jesus' resurrection in multiple sources, including non-Christian ones, provide further evidence for this historical event.

gemini-flash-1.5:
Focus on the **testimony of the apostles and early Christians as historical evidence**, rather than solely relying on faith-based arguments.  Highlight the transformative effect their belief in the resurrection had on their lives, pointing to the willingness to face persecution and even death for their testimony as strong evidence of their genuine conviction.  Discuss the historical impact of the resurrection narrative on the development of Christianity and its spread throughout the Roman Empire, arguing that such a widespread and enduring belief wouldn't have taken hold without a strong foundation in historical events.  Avoid getting bogged down in theological debates; stick to the historical evidence and its implications.

gpt-4o-mini:
One key point to support the position that "Jesus Christ's resurrection is a historical fact that cannot be denied" is to emphasize the historical evidence and documentation surrounding the resurrection. You can argue that multiple
