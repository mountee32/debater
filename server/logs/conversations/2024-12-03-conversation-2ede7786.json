      "content": "The assertion that \"We have no free will because God’s plan is predetermined\" lacks empirical support and logical coherence. \n\n1. **Definition of Free Will**: Free will refers to the ability to make choices unconstrained by external factors. Many philosophical and psychological studies indicate that individuals often make decisions based on personal reasoning and experiences.\n\n2. **Empirical Evidence**: Research in neuroscience shows that humans can make decisions based on their own thoughts and feelings. For example, a study published in the journal *Nature* found that brain activity related to decision-making occurs before a person is consciously aware of their choice. This suggests that while there may be influences, individuals still exercise a form of free will.\n\n3. **Statistical Analysis**: Surveys indicate that a majority of people believe they have control over their actions. According to a Pew Research study, 70% of Americans believe in free will, which reflects a common understanding that individuals can shape their destinies.\n\n4. **Counter-Argument**"
