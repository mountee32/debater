We all have our own beliefs about what happens after we die, and those beliefs can bring us comfort. My grandmother used to tell me stories about how she felt her husband was still with her after he passed. Those stories were her way of keeping his memory alive, just like many people keep the stories of Jesus alive.\n\nNow, when we talk about Jesus' resurrection, it’s important to remember that this is a deeply personal belief for many. But just like my grandmother’s stories, it’s rooted in faith and not something everyone experiences the same way. People have different beliefs based on their own experiences and backgrounds. \n\nSo, while some may feel strongly that the resurrection is a historical fact, others see it as a beautiful story that gives hope and meaning.
