Reforms like contribution limits and transparency requirements would help level the playing field.\"\n\nUser (Player)'s response: \"While campaign finance has issues, reforms often have unintended consequences that can make things worse. Contribution limits just push money into less transparent channels like PACs. Plus, donations are a form of political speech protected by the First Amendment.
