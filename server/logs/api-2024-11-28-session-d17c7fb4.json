This lends credibility to the accounts, making them more reliable historical sources.\n2. **Early Dating:** Stress that the New Testament accounts were written within a few decades of Jesus' death and resurrection, making it unlikely that myth or legend had time to develop and distort the facts.\n3. **Non-Christian Sources:** Cite non-Christian sources, such as Flavius Josephus, Tacitus, and Pliny the Younger, who confirm the existence of Jesus and the early Christian movement. While they may not explicitly mention the resurrection, they provide independent evidence for the historical context.\n4. **Historical Consensus:** Argue that the vast majority of historians, both Christian and non-Christian, agree that Jesus of Nazareth was a real person who lived, was crucified, and buried. This consensus is a strong foundation for accepting the resurrection as a historical event.\n5. **The Empty Tomb:** Focus on the fact that Jesus' tomb was found empty by his followers, which is a historically verified event. This, combined with the eyewitness accounts of his post-resurrection appearances, provides strong evidence for the resurrection.\n\nBy emphasizing these points, you'll be able to build a robust case for the historical factuality of Jesus Christ's resurrection.",
