      "content": "Here's my opening argument:\n\nAtheism is not a belief system, but rather a lack of belief in a deity or supernatural entity, making it fundamentally different from religion. Atheism doesn't provide a set of tenets, dogma, or rituals, unlike religions, which often have a clear doctrine and practices. To conflate the two is a false equivalence that misunderstands the nature of atheism."
