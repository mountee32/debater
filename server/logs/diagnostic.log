However, the outcomes were largely shaped by the social and economic conditions of the time, such as widespread poverty and inequality. These factors predetermined much of the revolution's course, suggesting that while individuals may feel they are making free choices, their actions are often influenced by larger forces beyond their control. This pattern shows that free will can be constrained by historical circumstances.",
