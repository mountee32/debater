Strengthen the initial argument by providing more specific examples or counterpoints to the Assistant's claims.\n2. Utilize more evidence or philosophical reasoning to bolster the argument against predetermined fate.\n3. Engage with potential counterarguments more directly to further solidify the stance against the notion of predetermined outcomes.",
