These documents were created within a few decades of the events, providing a close temporal link.\n\n2. **Eyewitness Testimonies**: The Gospels report that many people claimed to have seen Jesus alive after his death. For example, 1 Corinthians 15:6 states that Jesus appeared to over 500 people at once. This large number of witnesses supports the credibility of the event.\n\n3. **Transformation of Followers**: After the resurrection, Jesus' disciples changed from fearful individuals to bold proclaimers of his resurrection.

These texts, while religious, were written in a historical context and reflect the beliefs of early Christians who were willing to die for their convictions, suggesting sincerity rather than bias.\n\nRegarding discrepancies in eyewitness accounts, variations in details do not negate the core event of the resurrection; rather, they indicate that different perspectives can coexist in historical narratives. Furthermore, the absence of independent verification does not disprove the resurrection; it simply reflects the nature of ancient historical documentation, where many significant events lack corroborating evidence."
